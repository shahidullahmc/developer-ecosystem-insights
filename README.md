## 📖 About This Project
Developer Ecosystem Insights 2024 is a comprehensive analytical project designed to transform large-scale developer survey data into meaningful, decision-ready insights. The work blends rigorous data preparation, custom CASE logic, Vega-Lite visualizations, and interactive Looker Studio dashboards to reveal how developers work today, what technologies they prefer, and where the ecosystem is heading.

This project goes beyond surface-level charts. It includes a full analytical workflow—from data cleaning and transformation to exploratory analysis, dashboard design, and a consulting-grade written report. The goal is to make complex data accessible, human-readable, and strategically useful for learners, teams, and organizations navigating a rapidly evolving technology landscape.

At its core, the project reflects a commitment to clarity, analytical depth, and human-centered communication. It demonstrates how structured data, thoughtful visualization, and narrative synthesis can work together to produce insights that inform real-world decisions.
